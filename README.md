# Installation
It's recommended to install mvn for manage npm and node versions, in case that you have other project in your computer, first you need to check node version (node --version) . If it isn't installed we need to install a Node Run a new angular app --> npm install -g @angular/cli @angular/core . (no version as argument required to force upload the latest release version).

In case you do not install the latest version, set parameter to npm install @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18

Make sure that you use node version >= 23.x and npm at least 10.x, if not the compiler will show you a error that require versions no deprecated.
